    <H3>To prepare the Picos</H3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2
            cup vegetable shortening</li>
        <li>1
            cup milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2
            tablespoon dry yeast</li>
        <li>1
            cup sugar + 2 teaspoons</li>
        <li>2
            tablespoons lukewarm water</li>
        <li>1/2
            cup sugar</li>
        <li>3
            eggs</li>
        <li>1
            teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>5
            cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2
            cup dried cheese, coarsely grated</li>
    </ul>
    <H3>Directions</H3>
    <Ol>
        <li>To prepare the syrup: Combine the sugar and water in a small pot and bring to a boil over medium heat. Boil for 5 minutes. Let cool before using.</li>
        <li><p>To prepare the picos: In a small pot, heat the margarine together with the milk until it’s completely melted. Turn off the stove and let cool.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a small container, combine the yeast, the 2 teaspoons of sugar and lukewarm water. Let rest a few minutes until the mix has thickened and is bubbly. Incorporate the milk with the melted butter, at room temperature, and stir well.</p></li>
        <li><p>In a mixing bowl, combine 1/2 cup sugar, the eggs and salt. Incorporate the yeast mix and beat on low speed with the paddle attachment until thoroughly mixed. Add the flour and beat for 7 minutes. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate overnight.</p></li>
        <li><p>The next day, remove the dough from the refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 375°F.</p></li>
        <li><p>Divide the dough into 8 pieces and squish each piece down with your hands to give it circular shape. Flour the work space and your hands.</p></li>
        <li><p>Sprinkle the grated cheese over the top of each piece of dough along with 1/2 cup of remaining sugar. Fold one half in towards the center, and later the remaining 2 sides to form a triangle. Arrange on a greased baking sheet and let the dough rise for about 1 hour. If you’re in a very hot place, like Nicaragua, 30 minutes will likely be long enough. Bake for 25 minutes or until the picos have expanded and are golden brown.</p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Immediately drizzle with the syrup and let cool completely. Serve.</p></li>
